# Dividend Champion Gap Theory

My Google Data Analytics capstone project. 

I used the following tools:
- R - Used to scrape stock data
- SQLite with DB Browser - Used to locally create a database and perform SQL commands
- Tableau - Used for data vizualizations

If you want to invoke my scripts and SQL commands, they were performed in the following order:
1. script.R
2. create_prices_aggregated.sql
3. create_prices_increase_bool.sql
4. create_prices_increases.sql
5. create_prices_increases_aggregated.sql
6. create_increases_averages_info.sql
7. create_dividend_yields_bool.sql
