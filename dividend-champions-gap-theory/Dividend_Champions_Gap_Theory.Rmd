# Intro

Typically, when earnings are announced for a stock, the price gaps up or down depending on if the earnings exceeded or fail expectations. While there are ways to try to attempt to predict earnings, the process can be rather involved and complicated. Most people would typically advise against trying to make such predictions.

However, an idea came to me when I saw the price of a stock gap after a dividend increase: "Could you potentially trade stocks that consistently increase their dividends when they increase?". With that in mind, I narrowed down my criteria and came up with the following goal:

##### **“Do Dividend Champions consistently price gap once their annual dividend increase is announced?”**

For those that don't know, a Dividend Champion (DC) is a stock that has consistently increased its dividend for 25 years or more. This increase typically happens annually but there are some further considerations and nuances to that metric. However, I won't be describing those here. The important thing to know is that, based on the other considerations, the stocks used in this study may have: 

* A gap year before an increase happens
* Multiple increases in a single year

If you want to know more about DCs, you can read about them in the article, ["What is a Dividend Champion?"](https://www.dripinvesting.org/what-is-a-dividend-champion/)

While 25 years is the baseline to be considered a DC, the average number of years for stocks on the DC list is much greater than that. As of the time of writing this report, the average number of a years a DC has increased its dividend is 41.44 years. If combined with price gaps, this consistency could give traders the potential to safely predict price movements when a dividend increase occurs.

# Guidelines / Limitations

Before we move on, there are some guidelines and limitations to establish. The following shaped the creation of this project:

* The **[Dividend Champions List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D4H2OoHOFVPmCoyKBVCjxIl0Bt3RLYSz/edit?gid=923412609#gid=923412609)** created by **[DRIP Investing](https://www.dripinvesting.org/dividend-champions/)** will be used to determine which stocks are considered DCs.
* The past 5 dividend increases will be observed for each stock moving backwards from 2024-12-31.
* The day before, during, and after a dividend increase will be observed for any notable price changes.
* The 'quantmod' package will be used to obtain financial data from Yahoo Finance. The following stock symbols were unable to be pulled using quantmod and, therefore, were removed from the list:
  * ARTN.A
  * BF.A
  * BF.B
  * MKC.V
  * RBCA.A
* News and other economic data were not factored into these observations. This study strictly looked at dividend and price data pulled from Yahoo Finance.
